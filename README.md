# mastermind
This Ruby program is a take on the mastermind boardgame. It is one player versus the computer. The player can choose to be a code maker, or code breaker. The code is 4 digits long comprised of the numbers 1 through 6. When the player is the code breaker, the computer sets the code and the player has 12 turns to guess the rigth code, receiving a hint for matches and partial matches each time. When the player is the code maker, they set the code and the machine has 12 turns to guess the code. A result is declared at the end of each game and the game can be replayed. 

This is built using object oriented programming structure and uses a module, three classes, and many different methods for logic. 

If you have Ruby installed, you can download the ruby.rb file and run it locally, or play it online here: https://replit.com/@BenJ8/mastermind#main.rb
